# Cellular Automata and Conway's "Game of Life"

 This is an interactive program that simulates a cellular automation.
 You will watch the cells evolve, live or die, based on a set of rules.
The game board has start, stop, pause, and step through controls
Double buffering of game board data was used to calculate the next generation of cells.

# What is it again?
In 1970, Britsh mathematition John Conway developed a demonstration of cellular automation. 
It's not actually a game,as there are no players. You interact with it by creating a configuration
of cells a.k.a squares, or dots, on a x,y grid. It requires no more user input, but instead uses a set of rules 
to determine if a cell lives and is inclded in the next calculation, or dies and disappears.

# The rules are:
